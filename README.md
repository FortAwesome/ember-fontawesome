## Introduction

Hey there! We're glad you're here...

### Upgrading Font Awesome?

If you've used Font Awesome in the past (version 4 or older) there are some
things that you should learn before you dive in.

> https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/upgrading-from-version-4

### Get started

This package is for integrating with Ember.js. If you aren't using Ember then it's
not going to help you. Head over to our "Get Started" page for some guidance.

> https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started

### Learn about our new SVG implementation

This package, under the hood, uses SVG with JS and the `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core` library. This implementation differs drastically from
the web fonts implementation that was used in version 4 and older of Font Awesome. You might head over there to learn about how it works.

### Going from 0.0.x to 0.1.0

See [UPGRADING.md](./UPGRADING.md).

You might also be interested in the larger umbrella project [UPGRADING.md](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/UPGRADING.md)

## Installation

This project is an Ember addon. So we'll add that first:

```
$ ember install @fortawesome/ember-fontawesome
```

We need at least one style. Let's start with the free version of Solid.

```
$ npm i --save-dev @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
```

or with Yarn

```
$ yarn add --dev @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
```

### Add more styles or Pro icons

Brands are separated into their own style and for customers upgrading from
version 4 to 5 we have a limited number of Regular icons available.

**Visit [fontawesome.com/icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to search for free and Pro icons**

```
$ npm i --save-dev @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
$ npm i --save-dev @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
```

Do this for each icon pack you'll use in your app. By default, all installed
icon packs will be bundled into `vendor.js` and also added to the Font Awesome
library (i.e. `library.add()`)

If you are a [Font Awesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/pro) subscriber you can install Pro packages.

```
$ npm i --save-dev @fortawesome/pro-solid-svg-icons
$ npm i --save-dev @fortawesome/pro-regular-svg-icons
$ npm i --save-dev @fortawesome/pro-light-svg-icons
```
**Duotone icons are currently in pre-release and are coming soon to this component.**

Using the Pro packages requires [additional configuration](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/using-package-managers).

### Subsetting icons

If you want to include only a subset of icons from an icon pack, add a
`config/icons.js` file listing the icons you want to include.
The following example declares that all icons in
`free-solid-svg-icons` should be included build, 
and, only `adjust`, `ambulance`, and `pencil-alt` from `pro-light-svg-icons`
are to be included.

```js
module.exports = function() {
  return {
    'free-solid-svg-icons': 'all',
    'pro-light-svg-icons': [
      'adjust',
      'ambulance',
      'pencil-alt'
    ]
  };
};
```

By default, `ember-fontawesome` will warn if no icons are being included
in the build. To disable this behavior (e.g. if icons are being added by
some other means), set `warnIfNoIconsIncluded` to `false`.


```js
let ENV = {
  fontawesome: {
    warnIfNoIconsIncluded: false,
    // ...
  }
};
```

### Using within an addon

If you want to use icons in your addon there are a few steps to take.

First ensure `@fortawesome/ember-fontawesome` and any icon packs are in
the `dependencies` section of your `package.json`. This makes them available
to the apps that use your addon.

Second you need to declare what icons you are using so apps that subset icons
will know what to include. You do this in `config/icons.js`. The format is:

```js
module.exports = function() {
  return {
    'free-solid-svg-icons': ['bacon', 'pencil'],
    'free-brands-svg-icons': ['font-awesome-flag'],
  };
};
```

You should avoid listing any Font Awesome Pro packages as dependencies unless you are confident that whoever is using your addon has access to those.

## Usage

### Configuration

Out of the box, icons will use the Solid style unless a prefix is manually specified.
To change the default to Regular or Light, add a `fontawesome` configuration object
to your application's `environment.js` and set the `defaultPrefix` option.

```js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  let ENV = {
    // Add options here
    fontawesome: {
      defaultPrefix: 'fal' // light icons
    }
  };
  // ...
  return ENV;
};
```

As a reminder, the free version of Font Awesome does not include a complete set of icons
for any style other than Solid, so this setting is recommended only for Pro subscribers.

### Template

This is what it would look like in your template:

```hbs
<FaIcon @icon="coffee" />
```
All examples use angle bracket invocation available in Ember 3.4+. Using Ember's classic component invocation the example above would be:

```hbs
{{fa-icon "coffee"}}
```
For details see [Angle Bracket Syntax](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/reference/syntax-conversion-guide/#toc_angle-bracket-syntax) in the Ember documentation.

Without a prefix specified, the default specified in `environment.js` (or `fas`, if none set) is assumed:

```hbs
<FaIcon @icon="square" />
```

If you want to use an icon from any style other than the default, use `prefix=`.

```hbs
<FaIcon @icon="square" @prefix="far" />
```

### Static SVG Sprites

In situations where many icons are rendered to the page you can substantially improve performance by rendering
a [static sprite](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/advanced/svg-sprites) instead of the full icon component. Any
additional attributes you pass will be included in the `<svg>` element of the output.

```hbs
<FaStaticSprite @icon="coffee" />
<FaStaticSprite @icon="coffee" @prefix="fal" />
<FaStaticSprite @icon="coffee" class="my-custom-class" />
```

Because this transformation happens at build time some invocations will *not work*:
```hbs
{{!-- does not work --}} <FaStaticSprite @icon={{this.iconName}} />
{{!-- does not work --}} {{component 'FaStaticSprite'}}
```
